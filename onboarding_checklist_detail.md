**FAQs**

No, your project can continue using its existing moderation and reporting flows. The Foundation Code of Conduct does provide a Foundation-wide CoC team which your team may call on for additional assistance (see [#2][]).
* _Our project's current Code of Conduct is more specific, can we use it instead?_  
No - you must adopt the Foundation's Code of Conduct as a prerequisite for joining the foundation. If there are improvements or changes you would like to see made to the CoC, the Foundation warmly welcomes that discussion.
